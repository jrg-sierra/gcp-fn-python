# Google Cloud Functions
## New Functions Project

To start a project go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) or create it from [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)


# Creating a virtual environment
Install `python3-venv` using:
```
sudo apt install python3-venv
```
Then execute this command to create a folder called venv

```
python3 -m venv venv
```

Finally, to activate this virtual environment run:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

To add new packages to the virtual environments, you have to create a file called `requirements.txt` and to install those packages, run this command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
